Game Type: A 2D (top-down) casual farming/adventure game

- A game about farming and exploration on an alien planet.

General Plot: 

- You (the player) are a biologist and a member of an expedition in deep space searching for something unknown. Your ship crash lands on an alien planet, for unknown reasons, and you are tasked with helping the crew survive while trying to get rescued by growing plants to eat and research. The ship was stocked with a limited supply of seeds from Earth to get your crops started, but due to the odd growing conditions on the planet, you will need to learn about the local fauna quickly and adapt your garden or deal with mutations that occur as your crops adapt to their new home.

Gameplay Loop: 

- Each game "day" is the period between sleeping, however, time visually works based off of the IRL clock with some events or items only being available during various times (morning, afternoon and night) -> for accessibility, I'd like to add the ability for players to offset the clock in case there times outside the normal times they have access to play.
    - During the day, you do not have any kind of time or energy limit, and your goal is to work on your farm(s), do stuff in town, or explore. Each day, you can work your land as much as you want, but your plants only grow so much per day (each time you sleep) Water is managed via either carving groundwater channels, manually watering plants, or automated systems once researched. Plants can be then left to grow while you do exploration.
    - Explorations allow the player to visit randomized areas (some of which are new farm plots) where the player can collect supplies, learn more about the world/lore, find new strains of plants, collect research and more through puzzle solving elements. (or via access with tools player may or may not have access too)
    - Visiting Town, you can do a variety of activities, trade, further mini-games or puzzles, unlock or complete research, etc.
    - Day ends when you 'go to sleep', triggering a growth phase for anything you have planted
