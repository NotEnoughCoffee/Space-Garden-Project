(current) Game Title: Space Garden
Game Type: A 2D (top-down) casual farming/adventure game
    - Using Stardew Valley as a general guide, this game is more focused on farming and exploration on an alien planet.

General Plot: You (the player) are a biologist and a member of an expedition in deep space searching for something unknown. Your ship crash lands on an alien planet, for unknown reasons, and you are tasked with helping the crew survive while trying to get rescued by growing plants to eat and research. The ship was stocked with a limited supply of seeds to get your crops started, but due to the odd growing conditions on the planet, you will need to learn about the local fauna quickly and adapt your garden.

Gameplay Loop: Each game "day" is the period between sleeping, however, time visually works based off of the IRL clock with some events or items only being available during various times (morning, afternoon and night) -> for accessibility, I'd like to add the ability for players to offset the clock in case there times outside the normal times they have access to play.
    - During the day, you do not have any kind of time or energy limit, and your goal is to work on your farm(s), do stuff in town, or explore. Each day, you can work your land as much as you want, but your plants only grow so much per day (each time you sleep) Water is managed via either carving groundwater channels, manually watering plants, or automated systems once researched. Plants can be then left to grow while you do exploration.
    - Explorations allow the player to visit randomized areas (some of which are new farm plots) where the player can collect supplies, learn more about the world/lore, find new strains of plants, collect research and more through puzzle solving elements. (or via access with tools player may or may not have access too)
    - Visiting Town, you can do a variety of activities, trade, further mini-games or puzzles, unlock or complete research, etc.
    - Day ends when you 'go to sleep', triggering a growth phase for anything you have planted

Game Style: Top Down 2D (Stardew, Zelda, etc.)
    -> Tile based backgrounds.
    -> multiple layers of elements loaded over each other

Controls:
    -> simple movement controls, unsure if it needs to be locked to a grid (poke-mon style) or free roam (zelda).

Main Features:
    -> Gardening/Plant management + decorative/functional item building
    -> Researching for plants information + mutations
        -> Plant Stats + Quality
            -> Water Level
            -> Light Exposure
            -> Soil Type
            -> Special Growing Conditions
            -> Mutations
    -> Plant Randomization (a fresh game starts randomizes plants and their stats)
    -> Technology tree for tool/outfit/farming upgrades.
    -> Exploration
    -> Casual gameplay, no combat or time limits, no survivability.
    -> Deep game/universe lore to be slowly discovered
    ->

End Game:
    -> Triggered by opening communications off world and either being rescued, choosing to stay, or being stranded based on final 5 days of endgame
    -> After triggering the end, players will have 5 days to survive or do some task in order to be rescued.
    -> Figure out later

GENERAL ELEMENTS:

Entity -> 'name'
    - buffered images for movement in each direction
    - x/y pixel location (top left corner)

Player (extends entity) -> 'inventory' 'outfit'
    - handles movement (either character is fixed to center and screen scrolls, OR screen locked, and character moves freely around the frame) (need center screen x/y) -> can this be a combo of the two, where when the screen is at an edge, it stops moving but the character keeps going, but when the character goes in a direction with more offscreen, it locks back onto the character for that direction?? so centered on player unless at edge of an area.
